EzCopy Vue Extension (source)

How to use:
1. Download and unzip this project.
2. In the project folder:
   - npm install
   - npm run build
3. Open Chrome: chrome://extensions -> Developer mode ON -> Load unpacked -> choose the 'dist' folder
4. Open any webpage, select text and copy (Ctrl/C / right-click -> Copy). The extension will capture copied items.
5. Click extension icon -> popup will show captured items. You can search, copy, delete, or clear all.

Notes:
- This source is Vite+Vue. The dist folder is generated by the build step.
- If you want a ready-to-load unpacked `dist` now, I can instead provide a built zip, but that requires bundling; currently this archive contains source for building locally.
